## Exploring

<p></p>

Many of the views in the extension have a corresponding analogue in the Bzl UI.
Click on the blue stack.build `[Explore]` icon(s) to open the corresponding view
in the browser.

The UI offers more detail in terms of rule inputs/outputs/attributes, more
detail about the build event protocol, and many more features.  

Go forth and explore your build!
