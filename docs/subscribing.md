## Subscribing

Some of the features of this extension require a paid subscription.  While we
would like to offer a fully open-source model, using a subscription model helps
focus effort where the greatest pain points are.  Your support ensures that the
extension is continuously tested across linux, macos, and windows and that we
build out a feature set that is valuable and worth maintaining.

If the subscription model is an undue financial burden, please do not hesitate
and [reach out](hello@stack.build), we're always open to making it work for you.

To enable access for a set of developers within an organization, please reach
out to <hello@stack.build>.

### Getting Started

Subscription features are disabled by default.  Click the **Get Started** button
and enable the `bzl` feature:

### Subscription Flow

Follow the signup widget through the steps of choosing a subscription plan and
entering your payment details.

The flow terminates by copying the license token into your settings and
activating the feature:

### Reactivating the Signup Flow

If you need to get back to the signup page, invoke the **Bzl: Get Started**
command from the palette or click the *Rocket* icon from the account view:

To view your account details or manage your subscription, proceed to

### Telemetry.

This extension sends telemetry events to collect usage statistics on various
features of the extension to help prioritize new features and/or diagnose
problems.  No personal data is collected.  To opt out of telemetry, set the
`telemetry.enableTelemetry` to `false` (this is the same flag for vscode
telemetry itself).
